# DVIndustryExpanded
This mod intends to make running mixed freight consists in Derail Valley both possible and profitable. 
Uses both the Rolling Stock Ownership (By Niko Fox) and Production Chains (By GamingCookie) mods.
This will probably not be finished before the Simulator update comes out later this year, but it will still be cool to work on I guess.

# My problems with the vanilla Derail Valley jobs
I love Derail Valley, but really dislike having to go into the station to turn in job booklets (especially shunting jobs) as it breaks up the experience for me. 
I also really don't like that there are very few reasons to do mixed freight runs as it takes up alot of time to both assemble and break up trains.

# My (planned) solution
This mod aims to try to solve both of my gripes with vanilla Derail Valley. I plan on building off both Rolling Stock Ownership and Production Chains to completely
eliminate having to use job booklets and streamline the gameplay to make it both more (hopefully) fun and realistic to how actual railroads work. 
(Disclaimer, I am a programmer. I only know as much as our lord and saviour Hyce and other notable Youtubers teach me)
